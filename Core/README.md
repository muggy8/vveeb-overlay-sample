# Instructions for setting up Live2D Model

The contents of this folder must be obtained from the Live2D website directly as the code that is needed is not open source. As such you must procure your own copy of the Live2D SDK for Web in order to use this feature. You can obtain the code needed for that at [https://www.live2d.com/en/download/cubism-sdk/](https://www.live2d.com/en/download/cubism-sdk/) and download the "Cubism SDK for Web". You must agree to Live2D's download policy and after that, extract the zip file you just downloaded.

after that, within the contents of the zip file you just downloaded, you will find a folder also labled "Core". Replace this folder with the Core folder of the live2D SDK that you downloaded. That's all you have to do.
