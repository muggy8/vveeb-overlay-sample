# Setting Up

If you want to set up a Live2D overlay. there will be a few things you will need to do. Firstly, You will need your own Live2D model. You will need to place that model into the Resources folder under the right name. Then yo will need to replace the current Core folder with the Live2D SDK Core wich you can obtain from [https://www.live2d.com/en/download/cubism-sdk/](https://www.live2d.com/en/download/cubism-sdk/). Further instructions can be found in the [Core Readme](./Core/README.md)

After that, you will need to modify the configurations to display the right contents. You will need to open [configs.json][./configs.json] and change the related variables. After that, copy the contents of this folder into the VVeebLive/overlay folder on your phone and start the overlay.
